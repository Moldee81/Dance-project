        <h2>Why Cuban Salsa?</h2>
        <h3> Let Cuba's heartbeat move you</h3>
        <p>
          Cuban salsa—often called Casino—radiates warmth, spontaneity, and Afro‑Cuban flair. Born in Havana’s dance halls and blending Son, Rumba, Danzón, and Cha‑Cha‑Cha, it’s as much cultural storytelling as it is footwork. It melts stress, lifts your mood, and builds brain connections through rhythm and partner engagement.
        Cuban salsa is so much more than a style; it’s a social vibe, a cultural celebration, and a whole lot of fun with high-rife playful teasing and partner interplay. Cuban salsa is not just dance—it’s a party with roots.It’s ideal if you want to feel the music through your body, connect playfully with others, and move in fluid, circular rhythms that scream authenticity.

      <p>
        What sets it apart? Circular motion—partners orbit each other rather than exchanging linear slots—and full-body isolations, from hips to ribcage, that make you move with soul rather than just steps.
      In Casino, male dancers don’t just lead—they perform. Drawing from the Afro‑Cuban Guaguancó, men flirt through movement—bold, playful, teasing—seeking to capture attention and spark chemistry with their partner.
    Unlike North American salsa, where “men are the picture frame and women are the picture,” in Casino the man takes center stage. He’ll spin, isolate, and shimmy—not to overshadow, but to create playful interaction, inviting the woman into a dance of witty give‑and‑take rather than strict formality.

          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>
            Hey! I'm Anita. I have been dancing Cuban Salsa for many years
            but only recently, I started taking classes to learn it properly.
            Through this website, I hope to spread my passion and love for social
            latin dance, and to inspire others, to discover it too.
